CADI Software ChangeLog


Version 1.2.1                  2008-05-08
-----------------------------------------

* New features/improvements:

  - Title: client cache management policy
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Description: a cache management policy has beed added to the
    client cache. It allows to fix a maximum size for the data and
    to perform a management policy when the maximum size threshold
    has been reached. Two management policy methods has been
    implemented: LRU and FIFO

* Fixes:
  - Title: decompress independent components
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Identifier:
    Description: the bug was in BlockDecode class (CADIClient) and
    it did a bad decompression of an image when only one component
    had been requested. The bug was set in the version 1.2

* Other/Documentation:
  - Documentation about the server and client parameters has been
    updated.


Version 1.2                    2008-05-01
-----------------------------------------

* New features/improvements:

  - Title: spectrally transformed images
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Description: CADI software is able to manage JPEG2000 images
    spectrally transformed. This kind of images are not JPEG2000
    standard compliant, so the compresed-images main headers has been
    modified in order to support new parameters.
    CADI server has been adapted to read and decode the new main
    headers.
    CADI client has a new module to decompress this images
    (JPEG2KDecoder3D), and the JPEG2KLogicalTarget module has also been
    modified in order to read and decode the new main headers and select
    which are the needed components to decompress one.
  - Title: delivery progression orders
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Description: a new command line parameter (-dpo) has been added to
    the server. This parameter allows to delivery the requested WOI
    following a fixed progression order independently of the progression
    order used to save the codestream.
  - Title: -mr (--maxRate) line parameters (CADIServer)
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Description: a new parameter has been added in the server to limit
    the maximum delivery rate.

* Fixes:
  - Title: response WOI adjusting
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Identifier:
    Description: the bug was when the WOI was adjusting and the region-
    offset left coordinate was 0, but the top coordinate wasn't.
  - Title: achieved maximum number of bytes for a request
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Identifier:
    Description: the bug sent a wrong JPIP message when the maximum
    number of bytes for a requested WOI has been achieved but not
    exceeded, therefore a a wrong message was sent (but it did not
    have influence in CADI Client because it threw out the message).

Version 1.0.1                  2008-01-22
-----------------------------------------

  - Title: -cpit line parameter
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Description: a new parameter (-cpit) has been added to the
    input parameter line to choose the kind of CPI rate-distortion
    method used to delivery the requested WOI.

  - Title: decoding certain number of components
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Description: the JPEG2000 decoder has been updated to support
    decoding of certain number of components of the image. These
    components may be or not consecutives and all of the image
    components must be independent of the others.

  - Title: jpip client is able to get an image at a fixed target rate.
    Author: Jose Lino Monteagudo Pereira <jlino@deic.uab.es>
    Description: the jpip client (Client class in CADI.Client package)
